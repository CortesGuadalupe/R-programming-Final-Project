Fruit's Season Availability and Health Benefits Checker
This package's main two functions allow a user to check what fruits are in season and the health benefits of these fruits but it is important to mention that it is limited to ten fruits. When using the package the user must make sure to use the print function or it will not run as it is supposed to.
