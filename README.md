# Fruit's Season Availability and Health Benefits Checker
This package's two main functions allow users to check what fruits are in season and their health benefits. However, it is essential to mention that the package is limited to ten fruits. When using the package, the user must use the print function, or it will not run as it should. I have added some example print functions below each function, but the user can make their own based on what they are looking for.
